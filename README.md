Here are the necessary libraries to make this form, validating them with Javascript takes too long creating the functions for each rule and often becomes a task as necessary as dense. However, Jquery through its validate.js library makes it too easy. First, for this example I will use the version of Jquery 1.11 and the library for validation of forms named in the previous

# REQUIREMENTS:
Php 5.6, 
MySql, 
xampp or Wamp

# I will show you these other rules to validate a form:

maxlength: check that the number of characters is less than the specified

minlength: verify that the number of characters is greater than the specified

rangelength: check that the number of characters entered is within the specified range, for example rangelength: [50,250]

min: applies to numeric fields, check that at least a value equal to the specified value is entered

max: applies to numeric fields, check that at most a value equal to the specified value is entered

equalTo: it is used to check that the value of two fields is the same, for example the confirmation of a password or mail. Its use would be as follows: confirm_email:{equalTo:”#email”}

url: will verify that the entered value is URL format

email: check that the value entered is in the format of e-mail
